# Ratio-calculator
A ratio adjustment calculator for amending levels in formulae

I made this small ratio adjustment calculator for work, the smallest formulations can be two items long or as long as 30 so i made the option to add as many items (up to 30) as you need.

We usually have to amend certain levels of "diluent" in our work to fit the needs of customers,
this takes the smallest value found, gives it a base ratio of 1, then i find how many of those fit into each of the other components.
I then total the value of the ratios minus the diluent, divide the remaining value of the formula after the diluent value has been taken,
then that new value is what i multiply the ratios against to find their new value.
These then get assigned to the original values and the new diluent value gets amended to the formula to create a new total formulation.
